## Notes

(November 17th, 2021)

This is my second time implementing this project, though my first time actually submitting it. This actually *isn't* the project I had picked out to work on next, which is a more complex, multi-page design, but I needed the opportunity to practice on a smaller project with a new technology for me: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I've been resisting picking up Tailwind for almost the entirety of 2021, but I realized over the course of my last few projects that the custom Sass framework I'd been building was starting to look a *lot* like Tailwind itself with respect to the kinds of features I wanted to add to it. Rather than spend time and energy reinventing the wheel (particulary when I'm not picky about said wheel), I sat down the other night built out this challenge to learn the basics.

I don't know that I have enough experience with Tailwind yet to give an expert-level opinion on it, but after a few hours, my biggest criticism of it has nothing to do with its code, but rather its marketing. Tailwind tends to over-rely on shock value and disruption as its main selling points, which I suspect is one major factor in why the framework's elicited such a unique reaction from developers. But when you start to work with it, you realize that Tailwind itself is fairly tame and reasonable, and not at all disruptive to my workflow. Which makes the marketing a bit of a shame - I'd probably have adopted this six months ago if it wasn't for the aggressive copy.
